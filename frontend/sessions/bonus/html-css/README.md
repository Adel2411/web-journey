## 🎯 Workshop Overview

Welcome to web development! This workshop is for **complete beginners** with zero coding experience. In 1.5-2 hours, you'll understand how websites work and build your first web page.

---

## 🌍 How the Web Works

When you visit a website like `www.google.com`:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[👤 You type URL] --> B[🌐 Browser asks Internet]
    B --> C[📡 Server finds website]
    C --> D[📦 Server sends HTML/CSS]
    D --> E[🎨 Browser displays page]
```

1. 🔍 Your browser asks the internet: "Where is Google?"
2. 📦 Google's server sends back: HTML, CSS, and images
3. 🎨 Your browser displays the beautiful webpage

**This happens in under 2 seconds!** ⚡

## 🏗️ HTML + CSS: The Building Blocks

Every website uses these two languages:

| Language | Purpose | Like... |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **🏗️ HTML** | Structure & Content | The skeleton of a house |
| **🎨 CSS** | Styling & Design | The paint & decoration |

### HTML Example:
```html
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="A photo">
```

### CSS Example:
```css
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 2rem;
}
```
