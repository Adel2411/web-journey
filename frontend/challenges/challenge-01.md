# 🎯 Frontend Challenge 1: **React Foundation & Component Structure**

> **Build the core user interface components for CollabNote using React fundamentals**

Welcome to your first frontend challenge! You'll create the essential React components that will display notes for CollabNote using the fundamentals you learned in your first React session. This interface is designed to work seamlessly with the backend API from Backend Challenge 1.

---

## 🎯 Challenge Objectives

By completing this challenge, you'll build:

- ⚛️ **React application setup** with basic components and hooks
- 📝 **Note display components** using static data (API-ready structure)
- 🎨 **Beautiful, responsive design** using Tailwind CSS (already configured)
- 🔄 **State management** using React hooks (useState)
- 🏗️ **Component structure** that's ready for future API integration

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Completed Frontend Session 1 (React basics, components, hooks)
- Node.js and npm installed
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

---

## 📋 Challenge Tasks

### ⚛️ **Task 1: Project Setup**

You'll be working in the existing Vite React project with Tailwind CSS already configured.

1. **Navigate to your frontend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd project/frontend
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your project structure:**
   Create the following folders and files in your `src` directory:
   ```
   src/
   ├── components/
   │   ├── notes/
   │   │   ├── NoteList.jsx
   │   │   └── NoteItem.jsx
   │   └── layout/
   │       └── Header.jsx
   ├── data/
   │   └── sampleNotes.js
   ├── App.jsx (already exists)
   └── main.jsx (already exists)
   ```

### 📝 **Task 2: Sample Data Setup (API-Ready Format)**

**Create sample notes data** (`src/data/sampleNotes.js`):

1. **Create an array of sample notes that matches the backend API structure:**
   - At least 5 different notes
   - Each note should have: id, title, content, authorName, isPublic, createdAt, updatedAt
   - Use the exact same field names as the backend API
   - Mix of public and private notes
   - Different authors and content lengths

### 🎨 **Task 3: Note Display Components**

**Create Note List** (`src/components/notes/NoteList.jsx`):

1. **Display all notes:**

   - Import and use the sample notes data
   - Store notes in state using useState
   - Display notes in a responsive grid layout
   - Handle empty state (when no notes exist)

2. **Add interactive features:**
   - Button to toggle between "All Notes" and "My Notes" view
   - Simple counter showing total number of notes
   - Responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop

**Create Note Item** (`src/components/notes/NoteItem.jsx`):

1. **Display individual note (matching backend data structure):**

   - Show note title prominently
   - Display note content (limit to first 100 characters if long)
   - Show author name if available
   - Display creation date in readable format (using createdAt field)
   - Show if note is public or private with visual indicator (using isPublic field)

2. **Beautiful card design using Tailwind:**
   - Card-like layout with shadows and borders
   - Hover effects for interactivity
   - Color coding for public/private notes
   - Professional typography and spacing

### 🏗️ **Task 4: Layout and App Structure**

**Create Header Component** (`src/components/layout/Header.jsx`):

1. **Navigation bar:**
   - CollabNote logo/title
   - Clean, modern design using Tailwind
   - Responsive navigation
   - Prepare space for future authentication elements

**Update App Component** (`src/App.jsx`):

1. **Replace the existing content with:**
   - Remove the current "Hello World!" content
   - Include Header component
   - Display NoteList as main content
   - Clean, centered layout with proper spacing
   - Remove the default CSS imports and use Tailwind classes

## 🔗 Backend Integration Preparation

### API-Ready Data Structure

This challenge uses the exact same data structure that your backend API will provide:

- `id` - Unique identifier for each note
- `title` - Note title
- `content` - Note content/body
- `authorName` - Name of the note creator
- `isPublic` - Boolean indicating if note is public or private
- `createdAt` - ISO timestamp when note was created
- `updatedAt` - ISO timestamp when note was last updated

### Future API Integration

In Challenge 2, you'll replace the static sample data with real API calls:

- Fetch notes from `GET /api/notes`
- Create notes via `POST /api/notes`
- Update notes via `PUT /api/notes/:id`
- Delete notes via `DELETE /api/notes/:id`

---

## 🎨 Styling with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is already configured in your project! Here are the key classes to use:

### Key Tailwind Classes:

- **Layout**: `grid`, `flex`, `max-w-6xl`, `mx-auto`, `p-6`
- **Colors**: `bg-white`, `text-gray-800`, `bg-blue-500`, `text-white`
- **Spacing**: `mb-6`, `gap-6`, `px-4 py-2`
- **Typography**: `text-2xl`, `font-bold`, `text-sm`
- **Effects**: `shadow-md`, `hover:shadow-lg`, `transition-shadow`
- **Responsive**: `md:grid-cols-2`, `lg:grid-cols-3`

### Design Guidelines:

- Use consistent spacing with Tailwind's spacing scale
- Implement responsive breakpoints for mobile-first design
- Add subtle hover effects for better user experience
- Use semantic colors (green for public, orange for private)
- Maintain good contrast ratios for readability

---
